Revision history for Control-CLI-Extreme

0.01	2017-11-19
	* Initial; first version, branched off from Control-CLI-AvayaData version 2.04

0.02	2018-01-06
	* Method login() now will accept an empty password, for devices where no password is set but still prompt for
	  a password on connection
	* Adjusted cmd() method's timers for detection of command embedded prompt which were sometimes seen to give
	  some false positives

0.03	2018-02-11
	* Method login() was failing with SSH publickey authentication on ERS on TCP port other than 22

0.04	2018-02-17
	* Connection was not working to serial port of non-master switch in an XOS Summit stack

1.00	2018-02-18
	* First version posted on CPAN

1.01	2018-09-02
	* Internal method discoverDevice(), used by login(), was failing to set the default prompt on "Generic"
	  non-Extreme device types which used either '$' or '?' as last character on their prompts
	* Added support for ISW (Extreme Networks industrial switch range)
	* Added non_recognized_login argument flag to both connect() and login() methods, which controls whether the
	  login() method should immediately return when an initial login output sequence is not recognized or whether
	  the method should keep trying to read login output until either a recognized login prompt is detected or
	  expiry of the timeout
	* Updates to error patterns
	* Added generic_login argument flag to both connect() and login() methods, which disables extended discovery
	  if it is desired to connect to non Extreme devices using this class
	* Was failing to properly read attribute 'max_baud' on PassportERS family type
	* Attribute switch_mode was getting incorrectly set to 'Stack' on standalone ExtremeXOS x440 & x670

1.02	2019-05-01
	* Updated prompt detection for ExtremeXOS to handle cases where prompt preceded by '!' or an operational
	  status like (Demo), (Software Update Required), (orchestration vpex_peer), or anything in brackets
	* Updated attribute() to pick up service ports 1/s1,1/s2 on new VSP7400
	* Method attribute() was not correctly reading BaystackERS sysname if this contained spaces
	* Updates to ExtremeXOS error patterns

1.03	2020-02-26
	* Update to XOS y/n confirm prompt pattern
	* Added support for Extreme Networks Series200 switches
	* Added support for Extreme Networks Wireless Wing APs and Controllers
	* Added support for SLX Data Center switches
	* Attribute 'ports' now reports WLAN9100 ports as 'gig1' & 'gig2' (no longer 1 & 2) which is consistent
	  with how those ports are configured. Same with newly supported Wing products as 'ge1', 'fe1', etc.
	* Micro VSP XA1400 platforms now set "is_voss" attribute to true
	* Initial detection of device now works correctly even if discovery performed in config context mode
	* BaystackERS is no longer detected from prompt alone as there are now other Extreme family types with a
	  similar prompt regex
	* The default for output_record_separator is now Carriage Return ("\r") in this class. This differs from
	  Control::CLI's default of Carriage Return + Line Feed ("\n"); the change was necessary since SLX, over
	  the serial port, otherwise does not work properly. The change has no effect on all other Extreme
	  Networks devices

1.04	2020-04-25
	* SLX platforms on the serial port can place a -more- prompt even in the middle of a line. The cmd()
	  method was omitting output from that line immediately before the more prompt.
	* SLX platforms are quite dirty in the output they produce for certain CLI commands when executed
	  on the serial port. The cmd() method now deletes all those spurious escape character sequences.
	* Attribute 'switch_mode' was incorrectly getting set to "Stack" on XOS switch with dedicated stacking
	  cables connected but with stacking-mode disabled on the switch.
	* cmd_initiated_prompt() default prompt match pattern was not matching Y/N confirm prompts from
	  ExtremeXOS family switches and is now changed to: '[?:=]\h*(?:\(.+?\)\h*)?$'

1.05	2020-11-14
	* Update to PassportERS VOSS error patterns
	* Update to BaystackERS error patterns
	* Was not locking correctly onto BaystackERS CLI prompts with the TACACS suffix "<level-XX>"
	* Was not setting 'is_voss' attribute on new 5520 switches in VOSS persona
	* Attributes 'oob_ip' and 'is_oob_connected' were not getting set with the new VSP segmented management
	  stack introduced in VOSS8.2
	* Detection of attributes 'is_slx_r' was giving uninitialized value errors on SLX versions 20 and above
	  as the "r" is now omitted from the version going forward. Attribute 'is_slx_r' will still be set as
	  SLX versions beyond 20 are implied to be SLX-R code stream

1.06	2021-12-30
	* Was not correctly detecting the SLX9740
	* Changed the generic prompt regex to accomodate some Linux distributions where the prompt is coloured
	  using ANSI escape sequences

1.07	2022-08-28
	* Changes to correctly detect FabricEngine Universal Hardware VOSS 8.6.0.0 and set "is_voss" attribute
	* Changes to correctly detect SwitchEngine Universal Hardware EXOS 31.7 and set "sw_version" attribute
	* Fix to correctly set "fw_version" attribute on EXOS when both a Default and Alternate version are
	  reported
	* Methods cmdPrivExec() and cmdConfig() in some cases would return $ok true and an undefined $outputref
	  which goes against what was documented: Arguments after $ok will only be defined if $ok is true(1)
	* Methods cmdPrivExec() and cmdConfig() now have logic (using Control::CLI internal WRITEFLAG) to detect
	  if the last_prompt & config_context values might be stale, in which case a fresh prompt is collected
	  before proceeding. WRITEFLAG is introduced in Control::CLI version 2.11 and this functionality change
	  will only work with that version of Control::CLI or later, but does not otherwise make this module
	  incompatible with older versions of Control::CLI
	* Slot/Port detection changed to cater for new EXOS 5720 channelized ports on standalone units
	* PassportERS NNCLI more prompt adjusted, as the more prompt used by VOSS on command syntax is slightly
	  different, without the space characters

1.08	2023-06-18
	* Changes to correctly detect new ISW models : ISW-4W-4WS-4X & ISW-24W-4X
	* Implemented device_more_paging() for ISW, which can now be used to disable more paging
	* Added support for Extreme Networks Cloud APs (HiveOS, ex Aerohive)
	* Added support for Extreme Networks SD-WAN appliance (ex Ipanema)
	* Added support for new attributes is_fabric_engine and is_switch_engine
	* Added FabricEngine and SwitchEngine banner patterns to family type login detection 

1.09	2023-08-03
	* Modifications to support new Ipanema family type "router 1-3" CLI contexts
	* Improvements to detection of Ipanema family type

1.10	2023-10-08
	* Improvements to Ipanema family type prompt regex pattern
	* Update to default Y/N Confirmation propmt regex

1.11	2024-02-25
	* Introduced new family type ISWmarvell for ISW-24W-4X which uses a Marvell chipset
	  and a different software operating system with a different CLI. Both ISW and
	  ISWmarvell family types return true for attribute is_isw and both now support new
	  attribute is_isw_marvell which can be used to differentiate between them.
	* Y/N confirm prompts can now send "y" with or without newline character based on family type
	* Detection of Extreme Networks Cloud APs (HiveOS, ex Aerohive) was failing with latest firmware
	* New Universal Hardware series 4120 and 4220 have a restricted CLI, which has a prompt ending in "=";
	  adapted module to work with modified prompt.
	* Updated ISW error patterns
	* Removed useless debug level line in module constructor
